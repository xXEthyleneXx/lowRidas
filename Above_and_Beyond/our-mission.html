					How it all began...

					Owner and founder John Rhem began his official career in IT almost 15 years ago; 
					however, even before that he was highly interested in computers and electronics. 
					Having often worked on some unusual requests from friends to come up with out of 
					the box solutions for merging electronics and devices, John soon realized his 
					gift for adapting technology to best fit the needs of it's user. Also, beginning 
					his IT career as a PC/LAN technician for the Georgetown Steel Mill he learned 
					just what limits the average personal computer could be pushed to and what they 
					were truly capable of. At the mill, John honed his skills as a technician, 
					learning the finer art of customer satisfaction and the appreciation of a client 
					/ customer when you go above and beyond.

					After leaving the Steel Mill 
					in 2003 due to a massive layoff, John began the journey that would ultimately 
					lead him to become a Network Administrator where he would serve that role for 
					two companies over five years. From his early start working in the dust and debris 
					of the mill on desktop computers to his later years at a successful financial firm 
					involved with terabytes of data flowing across a network that spanned the entire 
					state of South Carolina; John has lived and breathed IT.
