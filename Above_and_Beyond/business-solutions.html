					In order to help you as a business and provide quality service, often times small to 
					medium businesses need more work than a single hour or even one visit can give. That's 
					why Above and Beyond IT Solutions LLC has both single service contracts and annual 
					service contracts available for your business. At 4 and 8 hour blocks you can reserve 
					time to fit your schedule and your budget since all service contracts feature discounted 
					rates. Ask about our *NEW* annual service contracts. Available in 4, 8, and even 16 hours 
					per month; an annual service contract is the closest your business can get to having an 
					in-house it guy without the cost. Ask about our single service or our annual service contracts 
					and let us help you select the one that best fits your needs.
